Monitering a Financial Fraud detection model 

The ML model of fraud detection is used to distinguish between legitimate and illegal transactions based on past behaviour and patterns from the historical data. Sometimes the models are not accuarate hence putting the customer's money at risk. In this project we moniter a financial fraud detection that has been working overtime & evaluate why it has been so. 

Montitering financial fraud  is crucial to business as it leads to customer loss & loyality, financial loss, increased scrutinity from the regulators and law enforcement agencies. Comapines use Machine Learning to mitigate money laundering. ML aids in detecting anomalies and patterns of fradulent behaviour. with the increased financial transactions, it is difficult to track money laundering activities manually.
